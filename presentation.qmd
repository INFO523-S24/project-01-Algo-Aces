# Understanding the Dataset 

# 

-   The dataset provides information on the nutritional composition of different fast food items as well as their respective calorie counts across 8 outlets- Arbys, Burger King, Chick Fil-A, Dairy Queen, McDonalds, Sonic, Subway and Taco Bell.                                                                    
-    Nutritional data, including calories, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbs, fiber, sugars, and protein, are included with every item in the dataset to give a thorough picture of the nutritional makeup of each food item.                  

#

-    It contains a variety of meal components, such as sides and main courses. This makes it possible to analyze both individual foods and possible combos to produce meals with certain nutritional profiles.                                                                  
-   Few of the main variables made use of in this project from the dataset are- ‘total_fat’, ‘calories’, 'protein'and 'cal_fat'.
-   The variety of food items available meets the dietary requirements and tastes of a broad spectrum of customers.


## Question 1:

‎

### How many calories does an individual consume per visit in a fast-food outlet?

## Plots for question 1:

::: panel-tabset

#### Plot A

![Violin plot explaining the distribution of calories per visit by restaurant.](images/output1q1.png){fig-align="center" width="720"}

#### Plot B

![The plot shows the count (median) of calories consumed by an individual per visit.](images/output2q1(corrected).png){fig-align="center" width="610"}

## Insights

::: {#smallerTxt}
-   Plot A (Violin Plot) represents the density distribution of calorie count through various outlets. It also shows the median values of each of the distribution. 
-   Plot B (Scatter Plot) provides a lucid visualization of the results of plot A, considering the median values to be the central measure of calorie count per visit to an outlet.
-   From the Plots A & B we can infer that Chick Fil-A has the lowest calorie count per visit with a value of 390 cal. Hence it is the better option of all outlets, especially for calorie conscious customers.

## Question 2:

‎

### How do different food item categories vary in protien-fat ratio and do they meet up to the standards of the health metric?

## Plots for question 2:

::: panel-tabset
#### Plot A

#### Plot B

![Scatter Plot depicting the Protein-Fat ratio for each restaurant.](images/output4q2(corrected).png){width="700"}

# Conclusions:

-   On an average visit from the list of 8 outlets- Sonic, Arbys and Burger King have proved to have the most calories in that respective order.  
-   Chick Fil-a and Subway have shown to have the largest protein-fat ratios.
-   Taco Bell, Sonic, Dairy Queen and Burger King have insignifact differences in their protein-fat ratios.

# Limitations:

:::{#smallerTxt}
-   The nature of the spread of the data made the mean unsuitable for analytical purposes, as a result, the median was used 
-   There were no meal combos for the food items in the data set. This would have made the analytical process a much simpler one. 
-   There were no sales information on the food items in the data set. This restricted our findings solely to health and nothing about the economical aspect.
-   The definition of what the health metric should be based on the dataset provided was made difficult. A special health metric was generated based on our analysis for this project.
