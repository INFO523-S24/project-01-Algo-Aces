### Dataset Description:

Provenance:
The dataset's sources are research institutions, open data repositories, or compiled data sets from various sources.

Dimensions:
The dataset contains multiple columns representing different attributes of fast food items, 
such as name, restaurant, category, calorie count, fat content, protein content, 
carbohydrate content, etc. The number of rows corresponds to the number of individual fast food items for each restaurant in the dataset.

#### **Reasons for Choosing this Dataset:**

Relevance:
Fast food consumption is a significant aspect of modern dietary habits, making this dataset relevant for understanding nutritional patterns and trends.

Health Awareness:
With growing concerns about obesity and related health issues, analyzing calorie content in fast food items can contribute to promoting health awareness and informed dietary choices.

Data Mining Opportunities:
The dataset provides ample opportunities for data mining tasks such as exploratory data analysis.

### Questions

Q1) How many calories are consumed on average per visit to each restaurant/outlet?
Q2) How do different food item categories vary in Protein/Fat ratio and do they meet up to the standards of the health metric?


### Analysis plan

Q1:
We will use the function `groupby.describe( )` which includes mean, mode, median, min, and max, to construct a table with summary statistics for each restaurant item in terms of calories.We are going to sum up all the calories for all the items in a restaurant and divide it with no of items gives avg calories gained by a person so we are going to use a half violin plot to showcase this result.

Variables used:

`restaurant`: Name of fast food joint or outlet
`item`: Food item being examined
`total_fat`: The total amount of fat in the food item
`calories`: The number of calories in the food item
`cholesterol`: The amount of cholesterol in the food item


Q2:
For question 2, the relevant columns will be protein, and item. To ensure when proteins and fats, we shall convert them from to calories. Using the protein-fat ratio, we can create a health metric that allows us to if a food item is healthy or harmful. We would like to visualise this using a half violin plot for better understanding of the metrics.

Variables used:
`restaurant`: Name of fast food joint or outlet
`item`: Food item being examined
`total_fat`: The total amount of fat in the food item
`protein`: The amount of protein
