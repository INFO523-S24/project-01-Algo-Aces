This makes it possible to analyze both individual foods and possible combos to produce meals with certain nutritional profiles.                                                                  \n-   Few of the main variables made use of in this project from the dataset are- ‘total_fat’, ‘calories’, 'protein'and 'cal_fat'.\n-   The variety of food items available meets the dietary requirements and tastes of a broad spectrum of customers.\n\n\n## Question 1:\n\n‎\n\n### How many calories does an individual consume per visit in a fast-food outlet?\n\n## Plots for question 1:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### Plot A\n\n![Violin plot explaining the distribution of calories per visit by restaurant.](images/output1q1.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"720\"}\n\n#### Plot B\n\n![The plot shows the count (median) of calories consumed by an individual per visit.](images/output2q1(corrected).png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"610\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Insights\n\n::: {#smallerTxt}\n-   Plot A (Violin Plot) represents the density distribution of calorie count through various outlets. It also shows the median values of each of the distribution. \n-   Plot B (Scatter Plot) provides a lucid visualization of the results of plot A, considering the median values to be the central measure of calorie count per visit to an outlet.\n-   From the Plots A & B we can infer that Chick Fil-A has the lowest calorie count per visit with a value of 390 cal. Hence it is the better option of all outlets, especially for calorie conscious customers.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2:\n\n‎\n\n### How do different food item categories vary in protien-fat ratio and do they meet up to the standards of the health metric?\n\n## Plots for question 2:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Plot A\n\n![Violin Plot depicting the Protein-Fat Ratio for each restaurant.](images/output3q2.png){width=\"700\"}\n\n#### Plot B\n\n![Scatter Plot depicting the Protein-Fat ratio for each restaurant.](images/output4q2(corrected).png){width=\"700\"}\n\n:::\n\n## Insights\n\n::: {#smallerTxt}\n-   Content\n\n:::\n\n# Conclusions:\n\n-   On an average visit from the list of 8 outlets- Sonic, Arbys and Burger King have proved to have the most calories in that respective order.  \n-   Chick Fil-a and Subway have shown to have the largest protein-fat ratios.\n-   Taco Bell, Sonic, Dairy Queen and Burger King have insignifact differences in their protein-fat ratios.\n\n# Limitations:\n\n:::{#smallerTxt}\n-   The nature of the spread of the data made the mean unsuitable for analytical purposes, as a result, the median was used \n-   There were no meal combos for the food items in the data set. This would have made the analytical process a much simpler one. \n-   There were no sales information on the food items in the data set. This restricted our findings solely to health and nothing about the economical aspect.\n-   The definition of what the health metric should be based on the dataset provided was made difficult. A special health metric was generated based on our analysis for this project.\n:::\n\n## \n\n![](images/thanksimg1.gif){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n",
