We will use the function `groupby.describe( )` which includes mean, mode, median, min, and max, to construct a table with summary statistics for each restaurant item in terms of calories.We are going to sum up all the calories for all the items in a restaurant and divide it with no of items gives avg calories gained by a person so we are going to use a half violin plot to showcase this result.\n\n Variables used:\n`restaurant`: Name of fast food joint or outlet\n item`: Food item being examined\n total_fat`: The total amount of fat in the food item\n protein`: The amount of protein\n\nQ2:\n\nFor question 2, the relevant columns will be protein, and item. To ensure when proteins and fats, we shall convert them from to calories. Using the protein-fat ratio, we can create a health metric that allows us to if a food item is healthy or harmful. We would like to visualise this using a half violent plot for better understanding of the metrics.\n\nVariables used:\n\nrestaurant`: Name of fast food joint or outlet\nitem`: Food item being examined\ntotal_fat`: The total amount of fat in the food item\ncalories`: The number of calories in the food item\ncholesterol`: The amount of cholesterol in the food item\n\n",
