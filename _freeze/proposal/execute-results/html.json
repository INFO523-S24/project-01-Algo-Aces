We will use the function groupby.describe( ) which includes mean, mode, median, min, and max, to construct a table with summary statistics for each restaurant item in terms of calories. We are going to use half violin plot for analysis.\n\n#### Question 2\n\nFor question 2, the relevant columns will be , , protein, and item. To ensure when proteins and fats, we shall convert them from to calories. Using the protein-fat ratio, we can create a health metric that allows us to if a food item is healthy or harmful. We would like to visualise this using a half violent plot for better understanding of the metrics.\n\n",
